# Natural Language Processing

# Study Effect of Language and Prior-Beliefs on Persuasion:
  Use of Ngrams, Lexicons, Liguistic features and User data
  to predict the winner of debates.
  
# Emotion Classification:
  Use of Dense, RNN and CNN for Emotion Classification

# SVD, Word2Vec and BERT word embeddings:
  Generate PPMI SVD based word embeddings
