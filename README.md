# Natural Language Processing

# Project 1:
  Use of Ngrams, Lexicons, Liguistic features and User data
  to predict the winner of debates.
  
# Project 2:
  Use of Dense, RNN and CNN for Emotion Classification

# Project 3:
  Generate PPMI SVD based word embeddings
  Generate Word2Vec based word embeddings
  Comparison of these embeddings on:
  * Word similarity - WordSim353
  * Analogy prediction - the Bigger Analogy Test Set
  * Paraphrase detection - the MSR paraphrase corpus
  
  Generate BERT word embeddings and train a Neural Net 
  to identify the word in context similarity
  
  Explore each BERT hidden layer representations for 
  NER, POS and REL task

# Project 4:
  Use of Image Data along with their Captions to generate
  image caption using Greedy, Beam and Nucleus Decoder.
